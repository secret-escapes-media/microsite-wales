    title: Elan Valley
    description: Home to a collection of reservoirs, the Elan Valley is a unique landscape in the middle of Wales. The towering dams built in the late-Victorian period are architectural marvels, shouldering vast, picturesque lakes. Walk through the valleys and discover a host of wildlife, on trails that fringe the glistening waters. The adventure continues into the night, with the valley designated as a Dark Sky Park making it a perfect spot for stargazing.

    title: Waterfall Country
    description: There are some truly spectacular waterfalls in the Vale of Neath. The Hollywood starlet is Henrhyd Falls, as featured in the film Batman – yet the heart of this fascinating spot lies further east. Try the Four Falls Walk to see the best of the Vale of Neath. From the dramatic Sgwd Clun-Gwyn that cascades from one tier into the next, to the spellbinding Sgwd yr Eira curtain where you can actually walk behind the falls, Waterfall Country is a truly magical place.

  - id: canals
    title: Canals
    description: Once the industrial lifeline for much of Wales, the canal network now offers a leisurely way of seeing the rolling valleys of the Welsh interior. Head for the effortlessly picturesque town of Llangollen, where a wild slate river sits parallel to a steam train and a canal. The canal still offers horse-drawn boat tours, but for a truly remarkable experience, take a barge across the nearby Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, a World Heritage Site,  which supports the canal over its lofty travels across the wide Dee valley.

  - id: snowdonia-lakes
    title: Snowdonia Lakes
    description: This dramatic land of piercing peaks and rugged valleys sports a mesmerizing collection of glistening lakes. Explore the golden glacial valley of Ogwen, or take the Miner’s Track that reaches the dizzying heights of Snowdon to pass Llyn Llydaw – breathtaking views await. The most famous lake in the region has to be Bala, the largest in Wales. Take a canoe to the water and glide along its serene waters. Nearby you’ll also find the highest waterfall in Wales, Pistyll Rhaeadr, with Lake Vyrnwy a little further on.

  - id: canyoning
    title: Canyoning
    description: Head for Glynneath in the beautiful Brecon Beacons for a spot of canyoning. The inland version of coasteering will see you spilling into wild waters, struggling upstream negotiating tricky outcrops, gorges, and a set of magnificent waterfalls. It’s a tough challenge which rewards at every turn – there’s no better way of experiencing the truly rugged nature of this wild landscape.

  - id: wye-valley-canoe
    title: Wye Valley Canoe
    description: The Wye is a truly idyllic waterway that cuts from mid-Wales down to the Severn estuary. Hire a canoe from Wye Valley Canoes and discover the beauty of the valley. Half a day will see you gliding into Hay-on-Wye, a remarkable stop. Or, head south and discover Monmouth with a stopover. Tintern Abbey and Chepstow Castle sit on the river’s banks further downstream, as the river closes in on the Severn.
