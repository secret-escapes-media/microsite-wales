      - title: The Mabinogion
        featured: true
        locations:
          - title: Bedd Branwen
        id: 'the-mabinogion'
        description: This medieval Welsh manuscript is a collection of Celtic myths and legends, stories of Welsh Kings and illustrious knights, with a penchant for broken hearts and magical beings. Head to Anglesey to Bedd Branwen, said to be the final resting place of the tragic figure, Branwen. A copy of the Mabinogion brings to life any outdoor adventure in Wales.

      - title: Dylan Thomas
        featured: true
        locations:
          - title: Laugharne
        id: 'dylan-thomas'
        description: Dylan Thomas, one of Wales’ most beloved poets, was in many respects a tortured soul with a gift for describing the human condition. He tells tales of curtain-twitching villagers, of remarkable mundanity, of romance, passion and loss, intricately laced by a lyrical style that offers as much fondness and unity as it does condemnation. New Quay, Mumbles and Laugharne are all previous haunts, most famous being the Browns Hotel in the latter. Visit the pub where he spent far too many hours and let the villages inspire your Under Milk Wood readings, before visiting his home at the boathouse.

        id: 'owen-sheers'
        description: Owen Sheers is lauded as one of the finest new poets in Britain. Since publishing a collection right after graduating and winning a tour with Carol Ann Duffy, he’s moved briskly into other platforms. Having travelled Zimbabwe and concocted the semi-fiction The Dust Diaries, he quickly moved to his next project Resistance, now adapted to an acclaimed cinematic adventure. Inspired by Wales, Sheers resides in the Black Mountains, the setting for much of his work. Head to Skirrid Hill with the eponymous poetry collection, or discover the Hay-on-Wye literary Festival where he is often found on the bill.

          - title: Llandaff
          - title: Cardiff
        id: 'roald-dahl'
        description: Born in Llandaff, a touch north of Cardiff, Roald Dahl inspired the imaginations of countless children with his wild depictions of floating peaches and loveable behemoths. A national treasure, his writing still inspires children to this day, handed-down by adults who, too, grew up on these fantastical tales. Pick up a copy of Boy, and seek out the sweet shop owned by Mrs Pratchett. Head to the Norwegian Church where Dahl was baptized and which he fought to save in the ‘70s.

The Romantics explored the ruins of abbeys and castles, Wordsworth and Turner penning lines and putting brush to canvas. Tolkien based The Shire on the idyllic Brecon Beacons, whereas Llandudno inspired Alice Liddell, the real Alice in Wonderland. See the Alice in Wonderland trail and find your own fantasy world in the Welsh landscape.
