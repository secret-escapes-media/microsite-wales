  - title: Renowned Literature
    description: Crumbling castles and dramatic natural scenes offer prized settings for the myths and legends that are still handed down from generation to generation. Fast forward to the modern classics, telling stories of pit communities and fantastical imaginations, the loss of innocence and dark lyrics on country life.

      - title: Dylan Thomas
        featured: true
        location: New Quay, Mumbles and Laugharne
        id: 'dylan-thomas'
        description: Dylan Thomas, one of Wales’ most beloved poets, was in many respects a tortured soul with a gift for describing the human condition. He tells tales of curtain-twitching villagers, of remarkable mundanity, of romance, passion and loss, intricately laced by a lyrical style that offers as much fondness and unity as it does condemnation. New Quay, Mumbles and Laugharne are all previous haunts, most famous being the Browns Hotel in the latter. Visit the pub where he spent far too many hours and let the villages inspire your Under Milk Wood readings, before visiting his home at the boathouse.

      - title: Roald Dahl
        featured: true
        location: Llandaff
        id: 'roald-dahl'
        description: Born in Llandaff, a touch north of Cardiff, Roald Dahl inspired the imaginations of countless children with his wild depictions of floating peaches and loveable behemoths. A national treasure, his writing still inspires children to this day, handed-down by adults who, too, grew up on these fantastical tales. Pick up a copy of Boy, and seek out the sweet shop owned by Mrs Pratchett (now a takeaway). Head to the Norwegian Church where Dahl was baptized and which he fought to save in the ‘70s.

      - title: The Mabinogion
        location: Bedd Branwen
        id: 'the-mabinogion'
        description: This medieval Welsh manuscript is a collection of Celtic myths and legends, stories of Welsh Kings and illustrious knights, with a penchant for broken hearts and magical beings. Head to Anglesey to Bedd Branwen, said to be the final resting place of the tragic figure, Branwen. A copy of the Mabinogion brings to life any outdoor adventure in Wales.

      - title: RS Thomas
        location: Eglwysfach
        id: 'rs-thomas'
        description: The Anglican Priest poet, the fierce nationalist, the fierce critic. RS Thomas never refrained from troubling the status quo. He turned the pastoral poem on its head, conjuring haunting images fraught with spirituality. An austere, meditative landscape pervades, a quality which throws alternative perspective on the verdant valleys you’ll explore. Alight at the eponymous Literature Festival to celebrate the poet and new poets in the area.

        location: Brecon Beacons, Llandudno
        id: 'inspired-writers'
        description: The dramatic landscape of Wales has inspired a countless number of writers and poets. The Romantics explored the ruins of abbeys and castles, Wordsworth and Turner penning lines and putting brush to canvas. Tolkien based The Shire on the idyllic Brecon Beacons, whereas Llandudno inspired Alice Liddell, the real Alice in Wonderland. See the Alice in Wonderland trail and find your own fantasy world in the Welsh landscape.
