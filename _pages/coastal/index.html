    title: Pembrokeshire Coast
    description: Weather-beaten cliffs, hidden coves and shimmering rock pools stretch along the south-western edge of Wales.

    title: Snowdonia Coast
    description: Where the piercing mountains of Snowdonia meet the sea, you’ll find a coastline of ravishing beauty. Visit the Italianate wonder of Portmeirion, explore the ancient walls of Harlech, Caernarfon and Conwy castles, or sink into a cosy cafe in Barmouth. Head for Bardsey Island, which fosters an incredible amount of history that belies its small size. The Llŷn Peninsula offers true hidden beauty, with a mix of Iron Age hill forts, abundant wildlife and quaint seaside towns like Aberdaron and Abersoch, ripe for exploring.

    title: Thrill seekers
    description: The Welsh coastline is a lengthy stretch of wild seas, where thrill seekers revel in adventurous aquatic activities. Windsurf at Cardigan Bay, discover the home of Welsh surfing at Rhossili Bay, or try something a little more out there. Coasteering, particularly around Pembrokeshire, will see you jumping off cliffs into chilly waters, letting the thundering waves feed your adrenaline as you scrabble to the rocks – an experience not to be missed by thrill seekers.

    title: Classic Seaside Getaways
    description: For plenty of Brits, the classic Welsh seaside towns evoke pure nostalgia; family camping holidays and bank holiday mondays, framed by 99s with a flake and fish and chips on the beach. From Tenby to Prestatyn via Aberystwyth, you’ll find Victorian seafronts and amusements (yes, that includes pier arcades and small-gauge railways). Nostalgia is met with contemporary flair – Llandudno has a buzzing arts scene, with Swansea and Aberystwyth hosting student populations that frequent cool bars and quirky cafes.
