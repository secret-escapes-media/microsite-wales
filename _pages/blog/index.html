title: Discovering Pembrokeshire
intro: Hi! My name is George Hiles and I’m the Head of Media here at Secret Escapes. I love escaping with my family in the UK, taking my wife Emma and two kids Zack and Mia to great destinations from the Lake District down to Dorset. However, Wales always holds a special place in my heart. Here’s my most recent adventure.

        <p>Tenby is dominated by multi-coloured, pastel town houses dotted all along the seafront. It makes for an incredibly quaint scene and is undoubtedly what this small welsh town is most famous for. At the centre of the town lies the harbour which a lot of working life seems to focus around. We were lucky enough to stay in a house right on the seafront, overlooking St Catherine's Fort.</p>
        <p>Situated just off Castle Beach (one of Tenby's three major beaches), the island (and fort) is quite the sight. Originally built in 1870 for The Ministry of Defence it has had several uses over the years including most noticeably a Zoo in the 1960's! Regrettably at low season, when we were there, it was closed – but at high season (when the tide is low enough) they open the island and fort up to the public. It is a great place to look around – my kids loved it.</p>

        <p>Tenby is lucky enough to have four really decent beaches surrounding the town – North, Harbour, Castle and South beach. All of them are great in their own right but for pure expanse we found ourselves defaulting most days to Castle and South Beach (which merge into each other). At over a 1.5 miles long it's a great stretch for long walks.</p>
        <p>Tenby has definitely retained a truly quaint charm. There may be more people on the streets as the town becomes more and more popular, but the majority of shops and restaurants remain independent  and therefore showcase the craft and fine fare that Wales offers.</p>
        <p>With so much directly on our doorstep we have previously (and very happily) spent entire weeks in Tenby without getting in the car. Given a recent passion for photography (and a brand new National Trust membership card burning a hole in my pocket), I was keen to use my latest visit to venture slightly further afield.</p>

        <p>After a little bit of research we were told by numerous locals that Stackpole (only 20 minutes west along the Pembrokeshire coast) was a great place to base yourself for a proper day out. We headed for Bosherston Lakes, famous for its lily ponds, with a pre-planned two-mile walk that would take us nicely out to Broadhaven Beach. The walk was truly stunning allowing us to meander over the lakes using rustic bridges. As a relatively gentle walk it was perfect for the kids, culminating in an amazing expanse where the estuary meets the coast and Broadhaven is set out before you. We had been lucky enough to time our walk at low tide, showing all the wonderful curves and contours that nature has created.</p>
        <p>The beach itself (clearly helped by low tide) was wonderfully large and proved a great space for the kids to have a truly good run around and explore the many caves dotted along the shoreline. After many a sand castle we settled down for lunch.</p>

        <p>After lunch, we successfully convinced the kids it was worth heading along the coast to St Govan's Head and the infamous Saint Govan's Chapel. It’s a truly magical spot – the chapel dates back to the 14th century and is carved out of the vast cliff face. It’s a steep 52 steps to the top, but once there, we were rewarded with a truly mesmerizing scene.</p>
        <p>There are plenty more outings along the Pembrokeshire Coast – we have, and will in future, return many times. It meets all our needs for a perfect family getaway, always offering something new to try.</p>
